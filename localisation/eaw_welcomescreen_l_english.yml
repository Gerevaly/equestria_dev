 EAW_WS_TAB_3_TXT:0 "§GExpanded & racial technologies and units§!\n\nEquestria at War incorporates a fork of §YExpanded Technology + Industry + Equipment§! by §YGreatexperiment§! (used with permission), that has been edited and streamlined to fit our design goals better. This allows for a longer game with more technologies to research.\n\nEaW introduces §YMagical Equipment§! and a new resource - £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§! - used to produce it. §YMagical Equipment§! provides a more resource and IC-intensive and less reliable, but more powerful alternative to regular §YInfantry Equipment§!.\n\n§YPre-Industrial Infantry Equipment§! and §YArtillery§! have been added, to represent the weapons used by nations that have not yet industrialized.\n\nFurthermore, EaW introduced the §YRaces§! system. Each country has one of five races - §YPony§!, §YChangeling§!, §YGriffon§!, §YDeer§! and §YUnspecified§! (with more races planned). Each race has its own unique racial tech tree folder, and in some cases racial unique units. Races cannot be changed during the game (exception being an option for the Changeling-Olenian Commonwealth).\n\n\n§GSociety & research development§!\n\nIn order to better represent the differences in industrial/societal and research development of nations in Equestria at War, §YDevelopment§! and §YScientific Development§! idea categories have been implemented.\n\n§YDevelopment§! represents the general state of industrialization and advancement of economy and society. Low levels of §YDevelopment§! impose §RIndustry§!, §RResearch§! and §RPolitical§! maluses. §YDevelopment§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n§YScientific Development§! represents the level of education and research capabilities of the nation. Low levels of §YScientific Development§! impose §RResearch§! maluses. §YScientific Development§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country. For §YGriffon§! countries, owning major centers of learning in Griffonia can be used to improve §YScientific Development§! as well.\n\n\n§GNuclear Warfare changes§!\n\nThe potential of nuclear warfare and the horror of unleashing such terrible weapons is not quite seen in Vanilla. In order to rectify this, EaW introduces the following changes:\n- Nuclear attacks will now reduce the population of a hit §Ystate§!, using believable casualty numbers depending on state population and development (using multiple nuclear bombs on a state in short succession will not reduce population as drastically).\n- A §Ystate§! hit by a nuclear attack will receive the §YFallout§! state modifier, reducing state factories, supplies, division organization and increasing division attrition. The modifier will last for a §Yyear§!. Subsequent nuclear attacks will not stack the modifier, but will reset the one year timer.\n- Production of §Ynuclear bombs§! requires a supply of £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!. If none are available, no new §Ynuclear bombs§! will be produced. Each §YNuclear Reactor§! consumes 12 £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!.\n\n\n§GOperation Paperclip - post-war research bonuses§!\n\nAfter a country has been defeated in a war, and a peace conference has ended, the victors will have a chance to receive §Yone-time 15% research speed bonuses§! to §Ytechnologies§! that the loser had researched, and the victor has not. \n\nThe chance to receive the bonus is random, and calculated per technology. The more of loser's §YIndustry§! that has been taken over by the victor (either by puppeting or annexation), the higher the chance to receive a bonus, which means that not every victor will have an equal chance. The level of §YDevelopment§! of the victor is also a factor - the worse the Development, the smaller the chance.\n\n\n§GMusic Toggle§!\n\nEquestria at War includes a small number of new musical tracks. In order to allow the players to choose what kind of music they prefer, we have implemented a button in the §Ymusic player window§! (accessed by clicking the §Ynote symbol§! below §Ytime speed controls§!, and then the §Yleftmost button§!) allowing to choose between §Yboth Vanilla and EaW music§!, §Yonly Vanilla music§! and §Yonly EaW music§!.\n\nThe optional, but recommended §YEquestria at War Music Mod§! supports this feature as well.\n\n\n§GVarious AI Improvements§!\n\nAn effort was made to improve the AI. While it is by no means perfect, and most of the real improvements can only be implemented by Paradox, we have done our best to tweak AI's behaviors, and improve AI's handling of Division Templates. AI will use all of the added units and technologies. AI will intelligently choose Doctrines based on the bonuses they recieve in their Focus Tree. AI will use dynamic strategies to respond to events and changes on the world stage. Peace Conference AI has been improved, though it is not perfect."

 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria:0 "Northern Equestria"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria_desc:0 "The Northern parts of the Equestrian continent are dominated by cold temperatures and mountainous terrain. Because of this, the region suffers from a deliberating lack of §YInfrastructure§!, making logistics a challenging task.\n\nThe countries in the North of Equestria are notably a lot weaker than their neighbours to the South. As such, northern nations require a substantial amount of buildup and time to launch a successful attack on the south.\n\nPolitically and economically, §YNova Griffonia§! starts out as the strongest nation in the North, though it is not quite a regional hegemon, and can be overpowered by other nations, depending on the choices made during the game.\n\nThe North has to worry most about their neighbours to the south, mainly §YStalliongrad§!, the §YChangelings§! and §YEquestria§!. Seeing as how the North lacks infrastructure and industrial capacity in comparison to the southern nations, they are very vulnerable to attacks from their more powerful neighbours. That said, the mountainous and harsh terrain of the North does favor the defender.\n\nThe North offers a region with challenging terrain and tough starting conditions, and one must bide their time and exploit their neighbours to make further expansion outside the region possible."
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria:0 "Equestria"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Equestria_desc:0 "Western and Central Equestria feature a variety of different landscapes, ranging from mountain chains and jungles to snowy forests and flat grassland. Due to the varrying sorts of terrain, the level of §YInfrastructure§! can vary a lot between different states. This region also features a long coastline, most of which is controlled by §YEquestria§! at the start of the game.\n\nMost southern nations start the game with a relatively large amount of divisions and/or industry. This makes them big threats to outsiders, though the political landscape of most countries prevents them from breaching out into different regions of the world for a long time.\n\nPolitically, this region is largely dominated by §YEquestria§!, which has the possibility of exerting further influence if they so choose. §YEquestria§! starts out as a disarmed nation, unlike their main rival and opponent, §YThe Changeling Lands§!. They, unlike their Harmonic neighbour, start out with a bigger and more capable army, and aren't as peace-loving either. It is noteworthy that this region usually grows with tension, until §YThe Changelings§! declare war on their rival, as part of §Ythe Great War§!.\n\nThe usual strategy of most countries in this region revolves around a massive industrial and military buildup during the early game, resulting in a great, region-wide war during the midgame, and finally ending in the victory of one side, who will then be in a prime position for global supremacy. Generally speaking, if one wishes to compete in this struggle for power, they would need to be on the winning side during §Ythe Great War§!.\n\nEquestria features a large variety of terrain with varying levels of §YInfrastructure§!, and features some of the most powerful nations in the world. The gameplay is largely based around the central conflict between §YEquestria§! and §YThe Changeling Lands§!, which most of this region will be involved in."
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia:0 "Northern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Griffonia_desc:0 "Northern Griffonia is a mixture of flatland and mountains, with a very low level of §YInfrastructure§! and industrial development. The terrain, low §YInfrastructure§! and harsh weather can make it a challenge to supply your troops efficiently.\n\nThe North of Griffonia features nations with a generally low level of industrial capacity and development. As such, they have a very hard time expanding beyond the borders of their own region, and require a lot of time to build up and eat up other, smaller nations around them. Nations to the East or South could, if they so wished, easily overpower any of the northern nations through industrial and military might, something that northern nations have a hard time catching up on.\n\nThe strongest nation in northern Griffonia is §YThe Griffonian Republic§!, which starts with the most units and strongest industry of the North. However, they usually do not pose a threat to any of the other northern nations due to internal struggles and problems. As such, smaller nations can attempt to conquer smaller, weaker ones without intervention. However, they must do so quickly and prepare a solid defense, because their time is limited.\n\nThe North of Griffonia will see itself invaded throughout the early midgame by §YThe Griffonian Empire§!. They will be among the first to be targeted by §Ythe Empire§!, and as such do not have as much time to build up and grow stronger as other nations in different regions of Griffonia. Because of this, the North usually stands a very poor chance of defeating the Empire, and it requires a lot of skill (and a fair bit of convenient luck) to defeat the behemoth that is §YThe Griffonian Empire§!.\n\nThe North is a relatively empty, undeveloped chain of mountains, hills and flatland that lacks noteworthy industry. You are very weak at the start of the game, and must acquire strength quickly to avoid conquest through the claws of §YThe Griffonian Empire§!."
 EAW_WS_Central_Griffonia:0 "Central Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Central_Griffonia_desc:0 "Central Griffonia encompasses relatively flat grassland, but also incorporates some small mountain ranges. The Region has a generally moderate, if not high amount of §YInfrastructure§!, which makes the supplying and transportation of troops easy.\n\nCentral Griffonia starts out as a disunified cluster of nations, all having a small to decent industrial base. It is noteworthy that §YThe Griffonian Empire§! starts the game with several vassals under their control, and will be busy conquering these vassals to eventually become a strong industrial and military might on the Continent.\n\nCentral Griffonia is, in almost every way, dominated by §YThe Griffonian Empire§!. They start the game with several vassals under their control, most of which will eventually leave them. The Empire can quickly reclaim and conquer these vassals, however, only to unify most of Central Griffonia and become a powerhouse industrially and militarilly. As a vassal of the Empire, it is hard to avoid being crushed by §Ythe Empire§!, though as other nations in Central Griffonia, you are given until the midgame to prepare for an invasion by them.\n\nThe generally flat terrain and good infrastructure of Central Griffonia provides a great spot for military expansion. However, nations will find themselves at great risk, seeing as how they are dangerously close to §YThe Griffonian Empire§!."
 EAW_WS_Eastern_Griffonia:0 "Eastern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Eastern_Griffonia_desc:0 "Eastern Griffonia features a large variety of terrain, ranging from long, deep rivers and grassland, all the way to mountains and forests. The region features moderately developed §YInfrastructure§!, most of the time, though this can vary from one country to another.\n\nThe East features a relatively small industry at the start of the game but can build up a decent one throughout the game, which aids with further expansion and conquest.\n\nThe East has two big contenders for power, one being §YThe Griffon Revolutionary Army§!, which is located further to the south and can grow very rapidly through Conquest. The other big political instance is §Ythe River Federation§!, a loose net of Pony nations that aim to protect against outside threats, mainly the Griffons and particularly the Empire. Throughout the game, various nations inside §Ythe Federation§! will strive towards unifying the Federation into a single nationstate under their control, and any other surrounding nation would be best of with preventing this, as a unified Federation can easily overpower most neighbouring nations.\n\nThe East, due to the deterrence from §YThe River Federation§!, finds itself largely protected from outside threats, even from the §YGriffonian Empire§!. This offers much needed safety to eastern nations, giving them extra time to build up and acquire territory.\n\nEastern Griffonia encompasses long mountain ranges, deep rivers, and flat grassland, and offers a safe haven from §YThe Griffonian Empire§! and other Griffon invaders, resulting in a sometimes more relaxed, definitely not peaceful playthrough. The ultimate goal of the East is to either prevent or strive for the unification of the River Federation, depending on their choice of nation."
 EAW_WS_Southern_Griffonia:0 "Southern Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Southern_Griffonia_desc:0 "Southern Griffonia encompasses a variety of terrain, mainly flatland to west and more mountainous areas to the east of the Region. Due to this, this region is inherently split in half with Infrastructure levels. Countries in the Southwest of Griffonia, like §YWingbardy§! have a much higher Infrastructure level and easier time to supply troops than the nations to the Southeast within the mountains, like §YSicameon§!. This regions offers access to the Sea, though very few nations possess a capable Navy at game start.\n\nThe South features a moderate amount of Industry. Rapid industrialisation can give a nation the edge it needs over less developed neighbours in order to defeat them.\n\nThe South is politically and militarilly dominated by §YThe Kingdom of Wingbardy§! at the start of the game. They feature a much stronger Industry than any other southern nation, as well as a very strong military. In addition to this, they are the Leader of a powerful faction, the 'Karthinian Pact', which can act as a roadblock for smaller nations trying to grow in power within the region. §YWingbardy§! typically chooses a radical political path, such as fascism, and you should thus expect them to be wanting to expand and, at worst, wanting to kill you. A good defense against them is thus a good recommendation.\n\nWith the start of the lategame, §YThe Griffonian Empire§! will most likely be knocking on the door of the South, ready to conquer the entire Region. As a nation in the South, it is ultimately your task to survive this onslaught and defeat the Empire, though this is very challenging indeed, seeing as how §YThe Empire§! will have incorporated most of its territories back into its realm by the time they strike the South.\n\nThe mix of flat and mountainous terrain in the south makes it a moderately difficult area to traverse, while nations like §YWingbardy§! and, ultimately, §YThe Griffonian Empire§! will attempt to wreak havoc in the region. A nation must play their cards right in order to successfully expand without walking into certain doom."
 EAW_WS_Western_Griffonia:0 "Western Griffonia"
 EAW_WS_Western_Griffonia_desc:0 "Western Griffonia is a mostly flat and hilly region, with very few mountains. Despite this, the Infrastructure across the Region can vary largely, though it is usually at a moderate level. This region offers access to sea and houses a great naval power, §YThe Skyfall Trade Federation§!.\n\nThe Industrial capacities of the various nations in the west vary, though they usually feature at least a moderate, if not good industrial power. With these varying levels of infrastructure, it is an easy task for the stronger nations to eat up smaller, weaker ones before dealing with more dangerous enemies.\n\nWestern Griffonia is visibly dominated by §YThe Kingdom of Aquileia§! and its various vassals. It incorporates a good, strong early-game industry with a healthy amount of divisions. Due to this, §YAquileia§! could easily overrun smaller opponents. However, their political choices might distract them for long enough to keep yourself as a smaller nation and acquire more strength in the meantime.\n\nThrough the midgame, western Griffonia will be put to the ultimate test, as §YThe Griffonian Empire§! makes it way to reclaim its former territories, which includes all of the West. A Player will find that even a strong Aquileia will usually end up crushed under the Empire's hell, leaving the rest of the Region ripe for the taking.\n\nThe flat and hilly landscape of the West, combined with the decent amount of Infrastructure provide nations with the terrain that they need to wage quick wars and supply troops. §YAquileia§! is the regional power that one would need to protect themselves against, but in order to last throughout the midgame, a nation has to prepare and defend against §YThe Griffonian Empire§!. The West offers you a challenging experience, and a race against time."

Upon it lies §Ythe Arcturian Order§!, an ancient holy order founded around the faith and ideals of 12 churches dedicated to the sanctity of The Holy Light.\n\nA Thousand years ago, on the long night, necromancers came pouring from the east. Large armies of undead cadavers in tow, they nearly overwhelmed the the lands now known as §Ythe Arcturian Order§!. Local church militant were the only ones capable of doing anything to stem the tide and push them back.\n\nThe century that followed saw §Ythe Arcturian Order§! being formed by §YDesmond the Fell-Claw§!, Holy Father of the Sun Goddess. §YThe Arcturian Order§! was created for the sole purpose of protecting the living from the foul denizens from the east.\n\nEver since that fateful day nine hundred years ago, they have done their job.\n\nRecent years have written a different story however, as something is amiss in the Dread Peninsula.

 EAW_WS_EQC_desc:0 "Over 500 years ago the first pony traders lead by Coltlumbus settled on the coast of Southern Griffonia and founded the colony of Celestia. Since then, years of immigration, colonisation and one-sided trade deals have resulted in the §YCommonwealth of New Mareland§!. A beacon of Equestria on Griffonian shores.\n\nWhile nominally still part of §YEquestria§!, New Mareland has its own government in the Commonwealth Congress and is subject to its own laws and regulations. The lax regulations in industry and employment laws, along with the valuable griffon market, lead to many Equestrian businesses setting up in New Mareland. \n\nHowever, on the 29th October 999, the New Manehattan stock market crashed. In what has become known as §RBlack Wednesday§!, thousands of New Marelanders suddenly found themselves without a job and the nation's economy fell into turmoil. Many New Marelanders turned to Equestria for help, but the homeland did little to help alleviate their problems.\n\nMany New Marelanders, now feeling abandoned by §YPrincess Celestia§!, have begun campaigning for the Commonwealth to seek full independence. This is championed by several charismatic ponies such as §YGladmane§!, §YKingfisher§! and §YDuke Haygle§!. However, the newly appointed Governor-General §YJet Set§! still maintains a solid powerbase in the Commonwelth Congress and popular support amoung the ponies of New Mareland.

However, New Mareland starts with a strong industrial base, particularly in its aviation industry. A strong Air Force, combined with a well dug in army, will be key in New Mareland's defence.\n\nThe Ponies of New Mareland find themselves in a crisis, and are surrounded by evil-minded nations in this foreign land.

The abundance of political exiles and emigres allowed the colony to quickly establish itself as an independent political entity, however due to the over-reliance on Imperial goods, the economy has stagnated.\n\nTo make matters worse, in the 30 years that §Ythe Empire§! has been in tatters, those former exiles, who under the old regime would have been disposed of, have started forming their own political organisations - §Rsome exceptionaly radical§!.

Their conquest of the Griffonian continent was haulted by the Pony tribes to the east, however, who formed the everlasting §RRiver Coalition§! to oppose and stop §Ythe Empire§! from threatening their sovereignty. With this hault in expansionism, many peasants and previously conquered noble families had time to plot against §Ythe Emperor§! and his rule, beginning to see him as a tyrant, rather than a just ruler. The true §Rdecline of the Empire§! did not start until the Griffinstone Dynasty eventually lost hold of the §YIdol of Boreas§!, an ancient relic that was used to justify §Yimperial rule§!. With this loss, uprisings quickly followed.\n\nIt all began in the year 978. The Empire was in a §YRegency§! following the death of previous Emperor §YGrover IV§!. However, the §GImperial nobility§! wanted to carve out a larger powerbase for themselves, and thus prevented §YGrover V§! from ascending to the throne, even after he became of age. This unjust regency came to an abrupt hault in the Winter of §Y978§! when thousands of angry peasants and lowborn assaulted the imperial palace.

For one reason or another, Changelings settled Greneclyf and had mostly stayed in isolation, praying upon the sapients on the main continent. These Changelings were much like those that are found in §YEquestria§!, but they were never as overt as those under the now infamous §YChrysalis§!. But for a time, they were driven back to their island. These were difficult times, as most teetered on the edge of starvation.\n\nThat was until a §YFarbrookian§! fishing expedition came upon the shores of Greneclyf. The Farbrookians, never having experienced Changelings, came across a starving §YQueen Dylis§!. And the chieftain, §YFingal§!, decided to openly help the Queen by sharing his affection and sympathy freely.\n\nThis was known as the §YFirst Sharing§!. It formed the first stable relationship between the Changelings of Greneclyf and the §YPonies§! of §YFarbrook§!. The friendship between the two houses would last for over eight hundred years until the present day.\n\nIn the meantime, Greneclyfians and Farbrookians came to form relationships that often were strong but never intimate. §YQueen Diedre§! once tried to further her friendship with the then-chieftain §YAlbar§!.\n\nSadly, she was rebuffed, even after she had offered refuge to him and his followers during a particularly harsh winter.\n\nStill, this gesture of friendship was still remembered through the weaving of the §YGreat Pacts§!: four pieces of tapestry worked both by Pony and Changeling hooves that detail the First Sharing and the §YFrozen Refuge§!. These would be shared by both countries' houses to continually remind their leaders of their shared history and inextricable friendship with one another. Now, §YQueen Gytha§! is the leader of Greneclyf, and §YCenhelm§! rules Farbrook. Sensing a shift in the air, she decides to convene her §YCouncil of Royals§! to come up with a new strategy. Having heard of just how large the world really is, Gytha is keen to show everyone that she and her people are not parasites, but a reliable and staunch friend.\n\nBut there is much that Gytha does not know, so she must first send envoys to these far-off places like §YEquestria§! and the §YGriffon Empire§! to see if any one of them will accept their offers of trade and friendship.

After the empire was united under Grover I of Griffinstone, there had been many attempts to underwhelm its power. \n\nThis came to a head in 971 ALB when King Griffberto died under suspicious circumstances whilst attending a party in Griffenheim. His son, the newly crowned §YKing Garibald Talonuel III§!, demanded that the lords of Griffenheim and the Imperial Heartlands launch a full investigation into the incident, but his demands fell on deaf ears. In protest, Wingbardy officially seceded from the Empire, taking its former vassals of §YTalouse§!, §YFranmisria§! and §YArantiga§! with it. The Empire, due to the young Emperor and rising instability, was powerless to protest as more and more nations followed in Wingbardy's example. \n\nWeakened by the collapse of the empire, and a long and bloody war with §YFalcor§!, the nation fell into economic crisis. Government after government came to power with the goal of restoring Wingbardy to its former glory, but each government collapsed under the strain and internal strife. Desperate for a solution, the griffons of Wingbardy turned to more drastic solutions.\n\nThe §YPartito Nazionale Fascista§! (National Fascist Party) lead by §YGiulio Beakolini§! has swelled in numbers, especially among the disillusioned veterans of the Falcor war. Beakolini has called for a march on Karthin to seize power from the government to begin rebuilding the nation. Meanwhile the §YPartito Communista Wingbarda§! (Wingbardian Communist Party) lead by §YAntonino Proletarino§! has vowed to stop any such action. With the threat of §RCivil War§! rising, the government has remained silent on the issue, for now.  But what they choose in the coming weeks will seal the fate of the Kingdom.\n\nWhoever takes charge of the government their priority should be to solve the nation's economic hardships. §Ythe Great Famine§! has decimated the already suffering nation. §YUnemployment§! is still rampant and the once mighty industrial sector has fallen behind nations such as §YEquestria§! and §YNew Mareland§!. These issues have also caused many of Wingbardy's best and brightest to leave the nation in search of fortune elsewhere.

Each Pony Tribe thought they were superior in a way, but only together could they survive in the end. Equestrian folkore says that the three leaders of the Tribes were locked away in a cave in the middle of a blizzard, and that the only reason they survived was cooperation and friendship. Henceforth, the Tribes were united under a common Banner and Flag: §YEquestria§! was born.\n\nFor the longest time, §YEquestria§! has been ruled by §YPrincess Celestia§! and her younger sister §YPrincess Luna§! as part of a Diarchy. The two Princesses are immortal Alicorns, and they are powerful enough to raise and lower the Sun and Moon. The Two Sisters have been the guardians of Equestria for a long time, defeating great, dangerous enemies such as §RDiscord, the Spirit of Chaos§! or §RKing Sombra§! of the Crystal Empire. §YPrincess Luna§! eventually fell prey to jealousy, however, as Ponies did not appreciate the Night she brought and incorporated as much as they loved the Day of her older sister. She transformed into the wicked §RNightmare Moon§! and fought §YCelestia§!, but she was banished to the Moon for a thousand years by her sister in the process. Now, more than a thousand years after this incident, Luna has returned, leaving her evil ways behind her and returning to rule by her sister's side.\n\n§YEquestria§! faces new enemies, however, as the evil §RQueen Chrysalis§! has rallied the disunited §YChangeling Lands§! under her supreme rule in recent history. §RChrysalis§! has already carried out a failed invasion on §YCanterlot§!, the capital of Equestria, and §YPrincess Celestia§! is worried that she will strike again, this time with full force.\n\nEver since the banishment of §RNightmare Moon§! over a thousand years ago, §YEquestria§! has protected itself through §YThe Elements of Harmony§!. Today, these Elements are embodied and held by six different Ponies, the most prominent of which is §YTwilight Sparkle§!, Element of Magic and Princess of Friendship.
