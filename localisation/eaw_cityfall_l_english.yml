 cityfall.1.t:0 "The Fall of Vaverfront"
 cityfall.1.d:0 "Reports from early this morning tell of Changeling forces overrunning the Oleanian city of Vaverfront, clearing out the last defenders desperately holding on to the city’s port.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Olenian civilians have been pouring out of the city by hoof or by ship, though it was too late for many as Changeling tanks caught up to them and blocked off every escape route.\n\nThe city, once a hotspot of radio traffic, has now gone eerily silent, with only celebratory music and speeches being transmitted by the occupying Changeling forces in the city."
 cityfall.1.a:0 "The Changelings are advancing..."
 cityfall.1.b:0 "This is just the beginning."
 cityfall.1.c:0 "We will avenge Vaverfront!"

 cityfall.2.t:0 "The Fall of Hjortland"
 cityfall.2.d:0 "Changeling forces have overwhelmed the last Olenian defenders in the capital of Hjortland. After infiltrating the ranks of the defenders, the changelings launched a surprise attack from without and within, quickly crushing any semblance of an organised defence. The last defenders retreated to the Hjortland palace, but their stalwart defense was no match to the elite Jagers units that assaulted the historic building.\n\nThe Changeling banner now flies from the ruins of the Riksdag as the surviving Olenian soldiers surrender to the victorious Changelings."
 cityfall.2.a:0 "The Olenians gave it their all."
 cityfall.2.b:0 "A great victory!"
 cityfall.2.c:0 "Is this the end?"

 cityfall.3.t:0 "The Fall of Cervus"
 cityfall.3.d:0 "Fighting has drawn to a close in the Olenian city of Cervus as changeling forces clear out the last defenders hiding within the city’s abandoned factories and apartment blocks. After heavy bombing by air and artillery, Changeling tanks broke through the impromptu barricades and sped through the streets to secure the docks and rail depot.\n\nWhat few Olenian defenders that remained were unable to evacuate due to the lightning-speed of the Changeling advance. As of this morning, Cervus is now officially under Changeling occupation."
 cityfall.3.a:0 "Is there no stopping the Changelings?"
 cityfall.3.b:0 "They were no match for us."
 cityfall.3.c:0 "We will come back for Cervus!"

 cityfall.4.t:0 "The Fall of Sakara"
 cityfall.4.d:0 "All effective resistance in the Olenian city of Sakara ended this morning after Changeling forces rushed the city hall and captured the Olenians' Sakaran Headquarters. A fire, possibly set by the retreating Olenian forces, ravaged the wooden city, forcing the invading Changelings to focus on putting out the fires.\n\nThe fires are out, but they have dealt a terrible toll in collateral damage and civilian casualties. Changeling stations have announced that the Olenian government is to blame for the tragedy, and that military field hospitals have been set up for the wounded."
 cityfall.4.a:0 "The Olenians are getting desperate."
 cityfall.4.b:0 "What a waste of life."
 cityfall.4.c:0 "Hopefully that bought us some time."
